</picture> Problem Statement :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> This project, titled ‚ÄúAI Based Discourse for Banking Industry‚Äù, aims at providing a platform for customers to clarify their queries online regarding banking. This is achieved with the help of a chatbot that is trained with some of the most frequently asked questions that banking customers usually tend to come up with. The chatbot is created using IBM Watson Assistant and is trained by manually adding the queries to it along with the relevant responses. The chatbot will then be available for use on a website which usually is the bank‚Äôs website for anyone to access.
Customers or anyone in fact can access the chatbot to interact with it and find solutions to their queries.
</li>
  </ul>

</picture> Problem Solution :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> With banking being an essential service that people require and with it being a slightly complicated and confusing topic for many, a lot of queries naturally tend to arise. For them to be answered as they are predominantly now in a manual aspect either by face to face interactions with a banking employee or through a customer care service, will require a lot of workforce and still end up with long waiting times. Hence, comes the need for an automated solution to the problem which can be easily handled by our chatbot. A chatbot is free, easy to use and is readily accessible at all times and from anywhere. It also provides instant reliable answers to queries and hence eliminating the need for the customers to wait to get their queries cleared. It also ensures that there is no spread of misinformation by providing official and authentic responses to queries straight from the bank sources. </li>
  </ul>
